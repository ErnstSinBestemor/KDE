OlaiOS

OlaiOS, is an Arch Based Operating System made for personal use for OlaYZen, This project will probably take a long time to make and hopefully become something Great!

Ill try to make it lightweight and no bloatware, and still be better than Windows.

Right now you need to manually Type in commands to get it up working, but im working on a Liveboot and a GuI which is automatic and just is plug and play.
